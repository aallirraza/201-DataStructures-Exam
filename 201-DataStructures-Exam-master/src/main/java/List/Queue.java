//Q4 List Queue
//Write the method void removeAll(Queue[] list)
// which removes all elements in the queues in the list from the original queue.
//You are not allowed to use enqueue, dequeue isEmpty functions.
//Solve for list implementation.



//Q3 Array Queue
//Write another constructor method
//public void Queue (Queue[] list)
//which constructs a new array based queue by adding the elements in the list of queues one by one
//So, the first k elements of the original queue will be constructed with the first elements of the k queues in the list.
//The second k elements of the orÄ±ginal queue will be constructed with the second elements of the k queues in the list etc.
// The elements from the queues should be recreated, not copied from the queues.
//You are not allowed to use enqueue, dequeue pr isempty functions.
//solve for array implementation

//Q6
//List Hash
// Write a static method
// int [] union(int[] list1, int[] list2)
//to find the union of the elements in two arrays and return a new array.
//The union array should contain only that many items not more not less.
// Your method should run in O(N) time.
// Dont use any external data structures or arrays except the resulting array and an external hash table.


//Q2 Tree Tree
// Write the non-recursive method
//int product() in Tree class that computes the prodcuts of all keys in a binary search tree by using stack


//Q5 List Hash
//Write the static method in hash class
// boolean sumOfFourK(int[] array,int K)
// takes an array of integers as a parameter and returns true if the sum of four elements in the array is K
// The method should run in O(N) time.
//You are only allowed to use an external array and external hash table.



//Q1 Tree Tree
//T1 and T2 are two binary Trees, Write the recursive method
// boolean isIdentical(TreeNode T1, TreeNode T2)
// in Tree ciass to determine if T1 is identical to T2
